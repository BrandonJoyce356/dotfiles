dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles which I manage with Stow.  Here is a nice post on how it's done. http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html

Things to Install
=================

- iTerm
- OhMyZSH
- tmux/tmate
- Docker for Mac
- Shush (for muting my mic)
